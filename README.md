2. **Select Datasets**: Choose datasets that are suitable for building a data pipeline and dashboard. Look for datasets with sufficient volume, variety, and relevance to demonstrate your skills.

3. **Design the Data Pipeline**:
   - Decide whether to implement a batch or stream processing pipeline based on your preferences and the nature of the data.
   - Choose appropriate cloud services and infrastructure tools for data storage, processing, and orchestration.
   - Define the steps for data ingestion, transformation, loading into data lakes and data warehouses, and dashboard creation.

4. **Set Up Infrastructure**:
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to provision cloud resources.
   - Set up data storage solutions such as AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, or Google Cloud Storage for the data lake.
   - Configure data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift for storing transformed data.

5. **Implement Data Pipelines**:
   - Develop batch processing pipelines using tools like Spark, Flink, or AWS Batch for ETL jobs.
   - For stream processing, utilize technologies like Kafka, Pulsar, or AWS Kinesis for real-time data ingestion and processing.
   - Implement workflow orchestration using tools such as Apache Airflow, Prefect, or AWS Step Functions to manage pipeline execution.

6. **Perform Data Transformations**:
   - Apply transformations using SQL, Spark, or dedicated data transformation tools like dbt to prepare data for analytics.
   - Ensure data quality and consistency through validation and cleansing processes.

7. **Build the Dashboard**:
   - Choose a BI tool such as Data Studio, Metabase, or Tableau for creating the dashboard.
   - Design intuitive visualizations that provide insights into the processed data.
   - Incorporate interactive elements and filtering options for user-friendly exploration.

8. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Document the project setup, data pipeline architecture, and dashboard components in a README file.
   - Write unit tests for pipeline components to validate data processing logic and ensure reliability.
   - Conduct end-to-end testing to verify the correctness and performance of the entire pipeline.
